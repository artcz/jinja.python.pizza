    <h2>Python Pizza is Coming to Prague</h2>
    <p>Python Pizza, an annual micro conference originating from Naples in 2017, has made its mark in various cities in Germany, Italy, Cuba, as well as in remote formats. Now, it's landing in Prague.</p>

    <p>Organized entirely by volunteers, we bring the Python Community together for some amazing original Pizzaâ„¢ and Python Talks.</p>

    <p>We believe in and encourage practical sessions, in which developers share their experiences and lessons learned from real-world projects. Each talk is 10 minutes long.</p>


    <p>Check out the past editions: Naples Python Pizza, Berlin Python Pizza, 2021 Hamburg Python Pizza, 2020 Hamburg Python Pizza and 2019 Hamburg Python Pizza.</p>
